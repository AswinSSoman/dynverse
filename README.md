# dynverse

**dynverse** is created to support the development, execution, and benchmarking of trajectory inference methods. Check out our preprint on bioRxiv:

Wouter Saelens\*, Robrecht Cannoodt\*, Helena Todorov, Yvan Saeys. “A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods: towards more accurate and robust tools”. bioRxiv (Mar. 2018). DOI: [10.1101/276907](https://doi.org/10.1101/276907).\
